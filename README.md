This is the README for Alexandra Amorati's final project.

This site's purpose is to provide information for the University of Notre Dame's
version of the game Humans vs Zombies. It will include a main page with news and
updates as the game actually occurs each semester. It will also include the
rules of the game, a list of the moderators, an explanation of moderators and
how to apply to be one, and a list of photos from previous games. Finally, as
an external site (HvZSource) handles tags and deaths, there will be a link to 
that site available on this site.

The breakpoints are at 700px (tablet) and 1000 px (laptop) and include a layout 
change mainly for the photos page. There are also slight modifications in image
locations on the rules page as well as the addition of a page navigation for the 
rules page in tablet and desktop modes. The margins of the text change with 
breakpoints as well.

The three-up column layout is implemented in the desktop-sized photos page.

The continuous CSS animation is the least annoying possible version of having a 
dart travel down the side of the home page over and over while you try to read 
the content.

The interactive animation is in the equipment section of the rules page, where 
on mouseover/mouseout the images will change slightly. Unfortunately on an 
actual mobile or tablet device this functionality would probably be lost 
because there is no mouseover/mouseout capability on many touch devices.

The background image appears down the side of all the pages.

The visual jQuery interaction involves stopping the dart, mentioned above, from
moving. I suppose it could be turned back on again but I'm not sure who would 
do that.
