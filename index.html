<p>Welcome to ND HvZ! This page contains information about the Humans vs Zombies game on the University of Notre Dame, St. Mary's College, and Holy Cross College campuses. For information about gameplay, see the Rules. For pictures from past semesters, see Photos. For registration, visit our friends at HvZSource.com or click the link above. For news, stay tuned! We'll keep you updated on registration, missions, and events right here.</p>
<h2 class="head">HvZSource</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the game, HvZSource is an external site that we use to keep track of who's a human and who's a zombie. Once you register with the site, you can join the ND game (if our registration is open!) and you'll be assigned a code to give a zombie once they tag you. If you get a tag, you enter it into HvZSource (ASAP!!) so that person is listed as a zombie.</p>
<h2 class="head">Becoming an OZ</h2>
<p>Ahh, so you want to be one of the first infected. Here's the main thing about being an OZ: you're expected to get lots of tags on the first day. If you don't think you can do this, because you're super busy or on crutches or a bad liar or whatever, please do not apply this semester. If you think you're up to it, contact us at ndhvz@fake.com</p>
<h2 class="head">Becoming a Mod</h2>
<p>Ahh, so you want to be one of the Game Masters. Here's the thing about being a Mod: it's a ton of work and you're expected to be there for all of it. If you can't make a meeting here and there and you really just can't be at that one mission, that's fine, but please be prepared to pull your weight. Mod responsibilities include planning missions, advertising the game, running informational meetings for players, playing NPCs during missions, knowing all the rules, giving lots of people your phone number, refereeing all the time but especially at missions.</p>
<p>Here's the other thing: the instant you attempt to abuse your power over the other players, we will kick you to the curb. Still think you want to do it? Contact ndhvz@fake.com</p>
